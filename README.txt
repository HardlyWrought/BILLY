Hello, World!

B.I.L.L.Y. is a lightweight, low-dependency chatbot designed to bring basic chat and semantic understanding capability to the world of embedded.

It is broken down into modules, including "text_data" "text clean", "text train", "text tag", and "text stem", build upon each other to
process everyday speech and extract increasingly complex information from it.
